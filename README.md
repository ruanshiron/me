## Personal
My name is Nguyen The Vinh (üáªüá≥). I currently live in Hanoi.

## Education

### High School 
Just a normal student at a normal high school üòÖ.

### University (2016 - 2021)
I completed my engineering degree at Hanoi University of Science and Technology (HUST) ü§î on time üòÖ.

## Intern and work
During college i interned and worked in several places related to programming and i enjoyed it very much.

### Ominext JSC (2018/06 - 2018/11)
I joined an internship program of Ominext JSC called Sakura Campus. I joined a team of 6 members, they are also trainees like me. We completed an internship with a face recognition project using the Kairos API. I learned a lot about iOS and Swift even though I don't use them now but it was a great experience. After 2 months of that program, I stayed as a software development associate (not too much to say).

### Sun* (2020/07 - 2020/09)
This is the 4th year of college, we have to participate in the school's internship program. Most of my friends are interns at Sun* and so am I. At this point we are learning ruby and Rails. We were assigned the topic of doing a recruitment website project. We finished the program quite well üëç.

### GHDC (2020/10 - 2021/03)
I found a part-time job thanks to an acquaintance. Work related to Angular, but really I didn't learn too much after this time. I found Angular to be more complicated, the company had its own code-base and I just had to follow through üòì.

### Fjord Bootcamp (2021/10 - now)
During Actindi's training, I learned on the website https://bootcamp.fjord.jp/. I learned a lot here about programming, Rails and Vue. As the name suggests, at bootcamp I learned a lot of great code from other people. I also wrote some other useful code while here.

## Languages
I don't really have a talent for foreign languages. Languages I know: 
- Vietnamese üáªüá≥ (of course) 
- English (5/10)
- Êó•Êú¨Ë™û (5/10)

## Hobbies
I don't have any long-term preferences. I used to like to draw a little bit, read a little book. Lately I've been enjoying cycling.
